# Subverso - Verso's Library for Subprocesses

Subverso is a support library that allows a
[Verso](https://github.com/leanprover/verso) document to describe Lean
code written in multiple versions of Lean. Verso itself may be tied to
new Lean versions, because it makes use of new compiler features. This
library will maintain broader compatibility with various Lean versions.
